# Graph_Series
Hi everyone,

I'm excited to announce that I will be publishing a comprehensive graph repository that will contain a collection of graph algorithms along with their code implementations and detailed explanations. Graph algorithms are fundamental in computer science and play a crucial role in solving a wide range of problems, from network analysis to optimization and recommendation systems.

In this repository, you will find the following graph algorithms:

1 .Breadth-First Search (BFS)
2. Depth-First Search (DFS)
3. Dijkstra's Algorithm
4. Bellman-Ford Algorithm
5. Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
6. Prim's Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Trees
7. Kruskal's Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Trees
8. Topological Sorting
9. Tarjan's Algorithm for Strongly Connected Components(find Articulation points in graph)
10. Kosaraju's Algorithm for Strongly Connected Components

will be update soon.....
